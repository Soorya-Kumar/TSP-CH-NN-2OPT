# TSP-CH-NN-2OPT

This program implements the Convex Hull Nearest Neighbor (CH-NN) algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using C++. It also utilizes the 2-opt heuristic to further optimize the tour obtained from the CH-NN algorithm.

## Overview

The Convex Hull Nearest Neighbor (CH-NN) algorithm is a heuristic approach to the TSP that involves finding the convex hull of the given points and then iteratively connecting the points in a way that minimizes travel distance. The 2-opt heuristic is then applied to refine the tour.
